I propose to create a cloud-based email client that is compatible with
existing email clients. It will have full send/receive capabilities with all
other email systems (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.). It will also have the
ability to receive and send encrypted messages signed with PGP public keys.

In particular, the client will support:
	Confidentiality: The message is encrypted with a session key, and then both
		the message and the key are sent to the receiver. However, the session 
		key is encrypted with the receiver’s public key to protect it during 
		transmission. The client will allow both the encryption and the 
		decryption of messages.
	Message Integrity using digital signatures: The client will also support 
		generating a digital signature for the message by computing a hash 
		(message digest) from the plaintext and then creating the signature 
		using the sender’s private key on the message digest. This will allow the
		receiver to verify that the message has not been tampered with en-route,
		preventing Man-in-the-middle attacks.

Other features: 
	1.  The first version of the client will only support plaintext email, but if
		there is time, I hope to enable HTML email as well.  
	2.  The client will have a web interface thus replacing commercial cloud email 
		providers like Gmail that are subject to NSA surveillance. I hope to host 
		the server in the Zoo and use Ruby on Rails to build the web interface. 
	3.  Another long-term feature I envision is to perform pattern recognition on 
		the previous emails received to calculate statistics like average time to 
		reply for each contact, best time to email a person, etc.
